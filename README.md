Economics C142: Applied Econometrics / Spring 2017 / UC Berkeley

An applied econometrics class taught by Professor Bryan Graham covering OLS with an emphasis on the projection theorem and inference, quantile regression, survival analysis, and networks.

These are my solutions to the three problem sets and four review sheets, and a final project analyzing returns to college majors using a quantile regression approach. Some (or all) of this may be incorrect; corrections are welcome.
