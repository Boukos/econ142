This could be due to the fact, for example, that many of the construction workers in this sample are older than average, and older workers get paid more, or that the field has far more men than women, and men get paid more. Effects like this are why we need to run a regression as opposed to merely presenting averages."

    "There are many interesting points to be made here, but here are a few key findings:\n",
    "* There are some majors whose returns pick up dramatically at the upper end of the earnings distribution, namely Biology, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and History. This probably reflects the fact that there are mostly relatively low-paying jobs available to those majors whose terminal degree is a bachelor's, but some students pursue further education and end up as well-paid professionals. We can imagine this being particularly true for Biology students -- the wage differential between a lab assistant and a surgeon is huge.\n",
    "* Business picks up at the 95th percentile: it's a relatively common major and is thus not unusually well-paying across most of the distribution, but there are likely a group of highly-paid executives that make business high-return at the upper end of the distribution.\n",
    "* There are a few majors whose returns consistently decline as we move up the earnings distribution, namely Education, Medical Services, Engineering, Computer Science and Architecture. It's not completely clear what's going on here, but one hypothesis is that these fields lead to well-paying jobs, but limited room for advancement. In other words, you're likely to make a good salary for most of your life, but unlikely to get rich.\n",
    "* Construction Services is one of the highest-return majors at the low quantiles, but has *negative* returns (in other words, lower returns than Agriculture) at the highest quantiles.\n",
    "* The best Fine Arts graduates are doing okay, but across most of the earnings distribution, the major has negative returns compared to Agriculture.\n",
    "* In general, the quantile estimates across much of the earnings distribution lie outside the OLS confidence band. This means that estimating the effect on average wages, as OLS does, does not tell the whole story.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration is that at *each* quantile, coefficients are estimated relative to the omitted category, Agriculture. Thus, we assume the line for Agriculture is relatively flat across quantiles, otherwise all of the other lines will be tilted accordingly. There is no good way of gauging which major to pick as the omitted category besides avoiding fields like Business, which we expect to have very different returns at different quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, the primary limitation of this analysis is that it doesn't control for degrees beyond a bachelor's. In other words, it could be the case that the 95th percentile of English majors are people who go on to law school and become wealthy. You could consider this part of the effect of earning an English degree, but it's also interesting to examine *just* the effect of the bachelor's degree field of study, controlling for higher degrees earned. It wouldn't be complicated to incorporate this -- the ACS has this field -- but with this quantile regression approach, at some point, the cell sizes will become too small. Also, these major codes are relatively coarse; Economics, for example, is absorbed in Social Sciences. The ACS has more specific major information (Chemistry as opposed to \"Physical Sciences\"), but again, we need to maintain sufficient cell size to estimate the quantiles (especially the extreme quantiles) with enough precision. If we aggregate data across multiple years of the ACS and use inflation-adjusted wages, and make the assumption that the returns to each major haven't changed dramatically over time, then we would likely have enough data to estimate these coefficients for the disaggregated major codes. These are promising areas for future work."
